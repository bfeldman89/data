The [first file](MSToday-20180222.csv) added in this folder, was the data MS Today shared from its analysis of the issue in late 2017. The data shared is limited. open-data/felony disenfranchisement/MSToday 20180222.csv

The [second file](suffrage-bills.csv) is my first open data contribution on Github. Moving forward, I will do a better job of currating how I scraped the bills for certain datapoints (like county of conviction, county of residence, and year of conviction). The code wasn't perfect, but the data was checked before it was uploaded here. With that said, **please comment here if you find an error.**

If you think adding another column of other data would make sense, let's talk about it. Ideally, the offense for which each petitioner was convicted would also be included. If anyone who is better at scraping documents than I am does that, I'll gladly merge the updated csv.
